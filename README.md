## Tech Stack

- **React**: Used for building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Sass**: Utilized for styling the components, offering advanced features such as variables and mixins.
- **React Slick**: Integrated for implementing sliding testimonials, enhancing user engagement and credibility.

## Components

The gaming web app consists of the following components:

- **Header**: Serves as the top navigation bar, facilitating navigation between different sections of the app.
- **Banner**: Displays a visually appealing banner with relevant gaming content or promotions.
- **CallToAction**: Prompts users to take action, such as signing up or exploring featured games.
- **Button**: A reusable button component for consistent styling and functionality.
- **LineStrip**: Renders a visually appealing strip with words and icons, enhancing the app's aesthetic appeal.
- **Filters**: Allows users to filter and refine their search results based on various criteria.
- **GameCard**: Represents individual gaming items, providing details such as title and image.
- **Testimonials**: Showcases user testimonials in a sliding format using React Slick, providing social proof and credibility.
- **Footer**: Contains essential links, information, and social media icons for easy navigation.

## Thought Process for Building the Gaming Web App

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:

   - Analyzed the requirements for the gaming web app, including the desired features and components.
   - Identified the need for a visually appealing and responsive interface to showcase gaming content effectively.

2. **Selecting the Tech Stack**:

   - Chose React as the primary framework for building the web app due to its component-based architecture and efficiency in handling dynamic UI.
   - Opted for TypeScript to enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity by adding static typing to JavaScript.
   - Selected Sass for styling to leverage its advanced features such as variables, mixins, and nesting, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability of stylesheets.
   - Decided to integrate React Slick for implementing sliding testimonials, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.

3. **Component Identification**:

   - Identified the key components required for the one-page gaming web app based on the project scope and user needs.
   - Prioritized components such as Header,Banner, CallToAction, LineStrip, Filters, GameCard, Testimonials, and Footer to ensure essential functionalities are covered.

4. **Component Architecture**:

   - Designed a modular and reusable component architecture to promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.
   - Structured components hierarchically, with higher-level components encapsulating lower-level ones to maintain a clear separation of concerns.

5. **Styling Approach**:

   - Chose to use **.module.scss** files for component styling to ensure encapsulation (enclosing the styles) and prevent styles from leaking or conflicting with other components.

6. **User Experience Optimization**:

   - Paid close attention to user experience (UX) aspects such as intuitive navigation and visually appealing design.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Documented the project, including component descriptions, usage instructions, and development process, for future reference and collaboration.
